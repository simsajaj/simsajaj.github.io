title: Week 9

This week, Dr. Ramaraj gave approval of the bar chart I created last week. He expressed that the design of the chart was sufficient and to continue to use that template of a chart. 

He provided me with the sample data in a text file. Subsequently, I invested a considerable amount of time and effort into developing a Python script designed to process the information contained within the text files. 

The primary objective of this script was to generate a series of stacked bar charts for each individual sample, each comprising four distinct data sets. These visual representations serve the critical purpose of illustrating the composition of various bacterial types contributing to the overall bacterial composition within each sample. These graphs would encompass various hierarchical levels, including (1) Kingdom and (2) Phylum.

In addition to the sample-specific stacked bar charts, I also created an aggregate bar graph encompassing all 40 data sets. This comprehensive visualization effectively conveys the relative percentages of bacteria and archaea within the dataset as a whole.
