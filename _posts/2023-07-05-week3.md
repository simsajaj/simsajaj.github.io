title: Week 3
---
This week, I had the assignment to get more familiar with Linux commands and practice using them in the terminal, specifically in iTerm. Dr. Ramaraj gave me a cheat sheet with commands, but the website link he provided was giving errors. So, I had to look up the commands myself while I was researching MetaPhlAn.

While I was digging into MetaPhlAn and trying to figure out how to actually run it, I found this website, https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/metaphlan/. It redirected me to a GitHub tutorial that explains how to use MetaPhlAn and gives you an idea of what it does, too. Here's the GitHub link: https://github.com/biobakery/biobakery/wiki/metaphlan4.

I let Dr. Ramaraj know that the link he gave me was no good, and I sent him the link I found about MetaPhlAn. He also wanted me to check if you can use metagenome assemblies as input for MetaPhlAn. From what I found, it seems like you can, but you have to convert the assemblies into simulated shotgun reads using MetaPhlAn2-Utils.

I think I have a decent understanding on how to run MetaPhlAn now, but I still want to go over it with Dr. Ramaraj just to be sure.
