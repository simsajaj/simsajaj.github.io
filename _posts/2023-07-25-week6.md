title: Week 6 
---
This week, Dr. Ramaraj and I reviewed the test sample we ran last week for practice. We successfully observed and analyzed the bacterial content of the sample.

Following that, I received clear instructions from Dr. Ramaraj to create 36 additional commands for the remaining 9 samples, with each sample consisting of 4 files, totaling 36 commands.

I diligently crafted all 36 commands for the 9 samples and promptly shared them with Dr. Ramaraj. I also brought to Dr. Ramaraj's attention that two samples, WH and CCW, had distinct file names compared to the others. 

Now, I'm looking forward to Dr. Ramaraj's feedback to ensure the accuracy of the commands, so I can proceed with running the rest of the samples.
