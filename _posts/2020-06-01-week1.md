This week, I had a kick-off meeting with Dr. Ramaraj, where he provided an overview of my responsibilities for the research project. He explained the project's purpose and mentioned that currently, it's just the two of us working on it. We agreed to meet every Tuesday to discuss progress.

During our meeting, I inquired about the tools I would be using throughout the project. Dr. Ramaraj informed me that I would be granted a login to DePaul's Linux terminal, which would grant me access to the soil data. With this access, I can analyze the data and report my findings.

To conduct the analysis, I will utilize collected data sets consisting of ten soil samples. Using specific tools available on the Linux terminal, I will examine the bacterial communities present in each soil sample. Subsequently, I will document and report my findings in a text file.

In the upcoming week, Dr. Ramaraj will provide guidance on navigating through the terminal and introduce me to the specific tools required for this project.

I have also met with my mentor, Dr. Mirjana Prpa, where we discussed the research side of computer science. We plan to meet again soon.
