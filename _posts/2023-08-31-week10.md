title: Week 10

This week, I met with Dr. Ramaraj during which we conducted a comprehensive review of the bar charts I had created the previous week. Dr. Ramaraj expressed satisfaction with the design and presentation of these graphical representations. During our discussion, we also examined the content of the text files.

After some discussion about how the code works, our decision was to proceed with the creation of taxonomic graphs for each individual sample. These graphs would encompass various hierarchical levels, including (1) Kingdom; (2) Phylum; (3) Class; (4) Order; (5) Family; (6) Genus; and (7) Species. 

However, it became clear that the inclusion of data beyond the "Family" level resulted in excessive bacterial types, creating the graphs to be challenging to interpret. Recognizing this issue, I informed Dr. Ramaraj.

In response to this concern, Dr. Ramaraj suggested that we continue generating the graphs as originally discussed, and he expressed his intent to provide further guidance and insights during our next meeting to find a suitable resolution for the challenge posed by the overwhelming number of bacterial types beyond the "Family" level. 

I have shared my script with Dr. Ramaraj.
