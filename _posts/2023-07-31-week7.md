title: Week 7 
---
During the course of this week, I had a productive meeting with Dr. Ramaraj, where he provided detailed instructions on how to execute each of the 10 samples accurately. In the previous week, I had prepared 36 distinct commands for the samples; however, upon reviewing them with Dr. Ramaraj, we identified a minor error in their pathway to the appropriate samples. Subsequently, I corrected the commands accordingly.

After making the necessary corrections, I initiated the sample runs. I have been diligently monitoring the program's progress, observing all 10 samples running, each consisting of 4 fastQ files. This will yield a total of 40 text files, which should be ready for in-depth analysis.

Moving forward, my goal is to collaborate with Dr. Ramaraj in order to review the bacterial composition of each sample and conduct a comprehensive analysis. Additionally, I have gained valuable insights into utilizing the terminal iTerm and Metaphlan, gaining proficiency in creating and executing screens as part of my continued learning process.
