title: Week 12

This week, I discussed the graphs I created with Dr. Ramaraj, and he gave his approval.

I generated forty bar charts, each illustrating the taxonomic levels for individual samples. As a result, every graph incorporates four samples, equating to four bars per graph.

Furthermore, I completed my final report and forwarded it to Dr. Ramaraj for review. Unfortunately, Dr. Mirjana Prpa, my mentor, could not participate in the final report assessment due to medical leave. In her absence, Dr. Ramaraj, my advisor, has graciously taken on the responsibility.

Once my final report is approved, Dr. Ramaraj will email Kathleen Kelly his approval and feedback per the final requirements.
