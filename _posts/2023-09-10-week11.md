This week, I communicated with Dr. Ramaraj pertaining to the graphical representations associated with each of the ten individual samples. During our discussion, I conveyed the challenge I encountered when attempting to interpret the data at the species taxa level due to the sheer volume of species involved.

In response, Dr. Ramaraj provided me with clear instructions to proceed, and to examine it together next time we meet. Subsequently, a substantial portion of my time was devoted to processing the data contained within the four text files corresponding to each individual sample, ensuring that all pertinent information was accurately represented in the resulting bar charts.

For each of the ten samples, including the composite 11th sample encompassing all samples, I meticulously generated visualizations in the form of bar charts, categorizing the data by phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.

I have shared these graphs with Dr. Ramaraj, awaiting his valuable feedback.
