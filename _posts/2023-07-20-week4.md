This week, I had a meeting with Dr. Ramaraj to discuss the various data files in iTerm. We reviewed approximately 8 files that need to be executed for each of the ten samples. Dr. Ramaraj provided guidance on running these files concurrently to save time.

We briefly explored the metaPhlan tutorial on GitHub, which I came across from Harvard University. We both agreed to use it as a reference throughout our research.

During our discussion on file execution and utilizing metaPhlan, we encountered an error. When attempting to create a new folder for storing the results, we were denied access and redirected to a folder that neither of us had permission to access. Consequently, we were unable to officially run any files or generate any results.

Dr. Ramaraj assured me that he will resolve the access issue so that I can proceed with testing the files next week. In the meantime, I have been studying the metaPhlan manual on iTerm and reviewing the corresponding GitHub website.
