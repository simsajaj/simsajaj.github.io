This week's meeting with Dr. Ramaraj ended up running longer than expected. During our discussion, he shared a new manual for MetaPhlan that we'll be using as our research guide. You can find it here: https://github.com/biobakery/MetaPhlAn

Dr. Ramaraj took the time to guide me through the manual, specifically instructing me on the process of creating a new file to store our results. In the previous week, we encountered difficulties in generating a new file due to not having access to the file/folder. However, during this meeting, we successfully devised an alternative method by creating our own folder where we now have the necessary access to save and retrieve our results.

Subsequently, we managed to promptly execute a test run on a single sample. However, after the meeting, I made several attempts to validate if the sample yielded satisfactory results, but I am uncertain whether I am accurately executing the required commands. As a result, I have reached out to Dr. Ramaraj seeking guidance, and I am currently awaiting his response.

In addition to these developments, I dedicated time to review the MetaPhlan manual and conducted further research on topics related to metagenomics, as well as familiarized myself with the specifics of FASTA and FASTQ files.
