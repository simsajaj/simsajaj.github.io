## About Me

Hello, I'm Samiha (Sa-me-ha), a 23-year-old first-generation student living in Chicago, IL. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at DePaul University. Before diving into computer science, I was actually on the pre-med track, with hopes of becoming a doctor. However, as I delved deeper into my studies, I found myself gravitating towards the technology side of the medical and healthcare world. That's when I decided to switch gears and embark on this exciting computer science journey. I'm expecting to graduate in the spring of 2025.

To give you some background, I earned my BS degree in Integrated Health Studies, with a concentration in Health Sciences, from the University of Illinois at Chicago. After finishing my undergraduate studies, I landed an incredible opportunity to work as a Health & Welfare Business Analyst at a trust fund company. It was during this time that I started seeing the potential for merging my knowledge of health studies with computer science.

As I continue to progress in my career, I'm eager to explore ways to combine these two fields and make a meaningful impact.

If you have any questions, or would like to chat, please email me at sajaj1@depaul.edu
