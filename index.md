## About Me

Hello, I'm Samiha (Sa-me-ha), a 23-year-old first-generation student living in Chicago, IL. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at DePaul University. Before diving into computer science, I was actually on the pre-med track, with hopes of becoming a doctor. However, as I delved deeper into my studies, I found myself gravitating towards the technology side of the medical and healthcare world. That's when I decided to switch gears and embark on this exciting computer science journey. I'm expecting to graduate in the spring of 2025.

To give you some background, I earned my BS degree in Integrated Health Studies, with a concentration in Health Sciences, from the University of Illinois at Chicago. After finishing my undergraduate studies, I landed an incredible opportunity to work as a Health & Welfare Business Analyst at a trust fund company. It was during this time that I started seeing the potential for merging my knowledge of health studies with computer science.

As I continue to progress in my career, I'm eager to explore ways to combine these two fields and make a meaningful impact.

## About My Project

The foundation of my project revolves around the examination of metagenomics in ten soil samples. Metagenomics entails the comprehensive analysis of entire nucleotide sequences derived from all organisms present within a collective sample, typically consisting of microbes. Its application often focuses on the investigation of specific microbial communities, such as those inhabiting human skin, soil, or water samples.

The objective of my research is to develop computational methods for exploring the metabolic potential of soil microbial communities in both restored and pre-restoration tallgrass prairies. Through the utilization of metagenomics, I will conduct an analysis of soil samples to identify the bacterial composition within them, observing the community structure and discerning any discrepancies.

On a weekly basis, I will document the similarities and differences among the ten samples. By undertaking this analysis, I aim to address a significant knowledge gap pertaining to soil communities, particularly the mechanisms by which certain microorganisms proliferate in varying soil types. This research endeavor will aid in unraveling the roles played by dominant microbial community members, ultimately facilitating the advancement of sustainable agriculture and enabling direct manipulation of soil microbiomes to enhance plant success.
